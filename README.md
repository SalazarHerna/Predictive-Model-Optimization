## Objectives

- Develop an MIP model to assign designs to machines, maximizing profit while adhering to constraints.
- Compare the optimized model against a traditional manual machine assignment approach to evaluate efficiency improvements.
- Use Python to implement the MIP optimization model and generate results that balance machine utilization, cost management, and production output.
- Optimize the production process, ensuring deadlines are met while maximizing profitability.

## Key Outcomes

- **Optimized Assignment**: The MIP model assigns designs to machines efficiently, maximizing profit and balancing workloads across machines.
- **Profit Maximization**: Compared to manual assignment, the optimized model increases overall profit by $13,759.87.
- **Cost Management**: The model optimizes variable costs such as setup and ink costs, leading to a reduction in overall costs while maintaining high output.
- **Real-World Application**: This approach ensures a scalable, real-time solution that can be applied to other production environments with similar constraints.

## Insights

- **Workload Balance**: The MIP model ensures that production machines are evenly utilized, preventing overloading or underutilization of machines.
- **Cost Optimization**: By factoring in setup and ink costs, the model minimizes these variable costs, improving the overall cost-efficiency of the production process.
- **Scalability**: The model is flexible and can be extended to handle larger orders, different designs, and more complex production environments.
